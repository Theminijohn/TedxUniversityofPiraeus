            She considers herself a global citizen. Born and raised on the shores
            of the Danube in Romania and hosted by the power of the Atlantic in
            Portugal, for the last 5 years. She has tried most of the areas that
            her economic background recommended her for, like: banking, project
            management, marketing and finance, but her passion for people was not
            being expressed in any of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Coaching came to give a name to what
            she was already doing but without knowing it, and it freed her from
            the system, where she was not fitting. Since she took this path, she
            is constantly designing her life and herself along with it. She is
            the expression of her passion for people and uses it as a catalyser,
            making this world a better place with each step she takes.

            He is the author of the book "the Chartering Practice Manual"
            (ex Chartering Practice Handbook), which is officially recommended for
            the seminars of HSA.  His hobbies are (but not limited to) sailing,
            theatre and literature.  Few of the short stories that he wrote during
            his limited spare time, were published but did not turn him into a
            "story teller" celebrity. Nevertheless, by the spring of 2010, his satiric
            drama "Tomorrow again" was put on act in the "Alma" theater of Athens.
